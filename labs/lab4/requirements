For this lab you will need to write and fully document a C program that can do the following:

1. use malloc() to allocate memory sufficient to store a list of integers.Note the list can be of any size specified by user input.

2. populate the list with integers entered interactively from the user interface.

3. Display the list of integers on the screen.

4. free() the entire memory used by the list.

Tips: Consider using a self-referential structure:

struct number

{

    int value;

    struct number* ptrNext;

};
